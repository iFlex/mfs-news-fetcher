This aims to be a service that offers good relevant news on broad topics of the user's choice.
A User would imput what they are interested in and the sourcers will look for such content. 
Why? 
1. to have one place for all the news (i generally like that, hate having to check 100 websites)
2. to avoid ML curation by the sources - thus hopefully showing content that truly matters to the user

DONE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Show content to the user in NodeShow
- Create NodeShow under given user's name - eliminates the need to have a HTTP server in this project
- Reddit sourcer
- WebsiteSourcer  => ArsTechnica, Hackaday, Computerworld, YCombinator
- [S] Ensure articles already sent are not sent again - Especially if the user deleted the article from the feed
- [M] Capture engagement - when user navigates to an article (Needs support from NodeShow)
- [S] Integrate callbacks from NodeShow to collect metrics on what the user does with the news bits: i.e. clicked on, deleted, prezzo deleted[L] Add the ability of some sourcers (e.g. website) to discover new content (e.g. navigate related links and categorise content, then match with user prefs)
------- Picks up click events - no support for save / rating yet
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Website Sourcers:
    - clean up how web sources are analized. - try to generalize the use of <article> and maybe some rules on hwo to figure out what is the title, link, image, etc.
[M] - Integrate persistence for user state (including Articles delivered, opened and rated)
[L] Add the ability of some sourcers (e.g. website) to discover new content (e.g. navigate related links and categorise content, then match with user prefs)
    - support save, rate
[L] Look into how to categorise an article automatically.
[S] New articles get sent to the top rather than the bottom of the list?
* Use NodeShow layout system: horizontal list, vertical list to style the newsfeed. Consider how to do it without too much coupling
* Templating on NodeShow side? Could help boostrap settings for links and abstraction rules
