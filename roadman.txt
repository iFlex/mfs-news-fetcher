This aims to be a service that offers good relevant news on broad topics of the user's choice.
A User would imput what they are interested in and the sourcers will look for such content. 
Why? 
1. to have one place for all the news (i generally like that, hate having to check 100 websites)
2. to avoid ML curation by the sources - thus hopefully showing content that truly matters to the user

DONE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Show content to the user in NodeShow
- Create NodeShow under given user's name - eliminates the need to have a HTTP server in this project
- Reddit sourcer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Website Sourcers:
    - ArsTechnica, TechRader, etc
* Use NodeShow layout system: horizontal list, vertical list to style the newsfeed. Consider how to do it without too much coupling
[L] Integrate callbacks from NodeShow to collect metrics on what the user does with the news bits: i.e. clicked on, deleted, prezzo deleted[L] Add the ability of some sourcers (e.g. website) to discover new content (e.g. navigate related links and categorise content, then match with user prefs)
