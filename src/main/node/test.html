Sure, the autonomous vehicle industry is still frontier tech that is years, even decades, away from becoming a product used daily by most consumers. Profits, hell even revenue, are distant goals.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, Argo&#8217;s demise did feel unexpected, largely because it had deep-pocketed backers like Ford and VW ($2 billion in cash and $1.6 billion in value of taking over VW&#8217;s Autonomous Intelligent Driving subsidiary), several high-profile partners with active pilot programs, a large workforce of top talent and a presence in multiple cities.<\/p>\n<p>The work culture wasn&#8217;t toxic, based on accounts from numerous insiders at different levels of the startup. It was a company widely respected and considered one of a handful of companies poised with the talent, backing and tech to actually pull off the commercialization of AVs.<\/p>\n<p>So why did Argo die? Did the founders or its backers make some fatal flaw along the way? Or is it a larger systemic problem with the technology itself?<\/p>\n<p>As I learn more about this (and I continue to dig), it seems it is a combination of a few factors, including Ford and VW deciding to prioritize near-term profits gleaned from advanced deriver assistance systems over a still-in-the-works technology that neither company had actually figured out a business model for. (or at least one guaranteed to be profitable)<\/p>\n<p>Argo apparently was able to find some new backers (Ford said in its earnings call that Argo couldn&#8217;t find fresh outside investment.) But finding capital wasn&#8217;t the only problem. The terms of any new investor would have to be agreed upon by Ford and VW. I have received varying accounts on the health of that relationship.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch editor Darrell Etherington makes the argument that this proves self-driving cars <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/27\/self-driving-cars-arent-going-to-happen\/\">are not coming anytime soon<\/a>. Cruise co-founder and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kvogt\/status\/1586390902830149632?s=20&amp;t=OJG8CdslDq8p_CR8Tm_J0g\">Kyle Vogt responded<\/a> with some light trolling on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson also piped up with an <a href=\"https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001828108-22-000118\/october272022dashboard.htm\">AV-industry-is-not-doomed message<\/a>. &#8220;This is not a signal that a future with self-driving technology isn&#8217;t real or imminent. In fact, it&#8217;s quite the opposite,&#8221; he wrote, noting Waymo&#8217;s expansion of a robotaxi fleet to LA and Cruise charging for driverless rides in San Francisco. Urmson also provided an update on Aurora&#8217;s focus on self-driving trucks.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t believe the AV industry is dead. I do see \u2014 and have for two years now \u2014 consolidation, tightening capital markets and a shift in priorities from automakers, which were once some of the biggest cheerleaders and backers of AVs. That makes a tough rough even bumpier. And for now, that shuts out a lot of startups.<\/p>\n<p>It would be a bit simplistic to say &#8220;it&#8217;s the profits, stupid.&#8221; But that&#8217;s not entirely isn&#8217;t wrong either.<\/p>\n<p>What do you, dear reader, think?<\/p>\n<h2>Deal of the week<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1894192 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png\" alt=\"the station scooter1a\" width=\"1600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=150,38 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=300,75 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=768,192 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=680,170 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=1200,301 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>On the day the Argo AI news dropped, <strong>Mobileye<\/strong> made its official debut. The success of the IPO \u2014 the third largest this year \u2014 was seen by many as a validation of Ford and VW&#8217;s decision to shutdown Argo. The takeaway was that advanced driver assistance systems, not AV tech, is the real future (at least in terms of revenue and profits).<\/p>\n<p>Mobileye was able to price 41 million shares at $21 and above its initial range, raising $861 million. General Atlantic agreed to buy an additional $100 million of shares in a private placement. Investors seemed ready to pile in and helped shares pop and close nearly 30% above the IPO price.<\/p>\n<p>I spoke to Mobileye founder and CEO Amnon Shashua on the big day. (Look for a longer piece this week.)<\/p>\n<p>A couple of quick takeaways from Dr. Shashua:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Things have changed and became more and more nuanced. You know, five years ago we&#8217;d be talking about driving assist and then robotaxis as kind of two separate domains. We gradually built a product portfolio that bridges the spectrum between driving assist and robotaxis.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That bridge, a technology called <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.intel.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2020\/09\/supervision-product-brief.pdf\">Mobileye Supervision<\/a>, is the critical foundation of the company&#8217;s future. This technology isn&#8217;t looming in the distant future either. The system, which includes 11 cameras around the car that feeds data into Mobileye&#8217;s system on chips, is on 50,000 vehicles in China. Shashua told me they started in China because the country is &#8220;more tech forward and is moving faster than anyone else.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>AM Batteries<\/strong>, a Boston-based company that has developed lithium-ion dry-electrode technology, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20221025005264\/en\/AM-Batteries-AMB-Secures-25M-Series-A-Financing-to-Scale-Manufacturing-of-Novel-Lithium-Ion-Dry-Electrode-Technology\">raised $25 million<\/a> in Series A round led by Anzu Partners.

For the mission, SpaceX will attempt to directly inject two U.S. Space Force spacecraft to geosynchronous orbit. The payload includes TETRA-1, a microsatellite developed by Boeing subsidiary Millennium Space Systems, which the company describes as a spacecraft created for \u201cvarious prototype missions\u201d in an around GEO. The other spacecraft is classified.<\/p>\n<p>While the Space Force originally intended to launch the USSF-44 mission in late 2020, it was repeatedly delayed due to payload readiness issues.<\/p>\n<p>Falcon Heavy is the most powerful rocket currently in operation, and it\u2019s only flown three times, the last of which took place in June 2019. Its maiden launch, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/06\/watch-the-live-feed-from-spacexs-roadster-driving-starman-in-space\/\">carried a Tesla Roadster<\/a> (and dummy driver) to orbit, is a particularly notable chapter in SpaceX history.<\/p>\n<p>The rocket is made up of a trio of Falcon 9 boosters, the very same ones that now launch at least once a week. The whopping 27 Merlin engines together produce around 5 million pounds of thrust. A Falcon 9 second stage and payload fairing is attached to the central booster.<\/p>\n<p>This will be the first launch for all three boosters as well as the upper stage and fairing.

Ukraine, energy costs have risen drastically \u2014 particularly in parts of Europe historically dependent on Russian fuel. That&#8217;s impacted data centers, which aren&#8217;t directly reliant on resources like natural gas but which often draw on power grids and backup generators that generate a portion of their electricity using fossil fuels.<\/p>\n<p>According to a July <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aggreko.com\/en-gb\/news\/2022\/noeur-news\/power-struggle-for-data-centres\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report<\/a> from power generation supplier Aggreko, data center operators in the U.K. and Ireland have seen their energy bills increase by as much as 50% over the last three years, with the steepest climbs occurring within the last year. Fifty-eight percent of those in the U.K. said that energy bills have had a &#8220;significant impact&#8221; on their company&#8217;s margins.<\/p>\n<p>It seems inevitable that the energy premium data center operators are being forced to pay will be passed along to customers. Indeed, it&#8217;s already happening.<\/p>\n<p>Way back in November 2021, Manchester-based cloud services provider M247 hiked prices a whopping 161%, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/2021\/11\/04\/m247_price_increases\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blaming<\/a> &#8220;unprecedented times in the European energy markets.&#8221; Cloud providers <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.ovhcloud.com\/ovhcloud-price-adjustments-in-2022-and-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OVHcloud<\/a>, based in France, and <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.hetzner.com\/general\/others\/price-adjustment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hetzner<\/a>, based in Germany, both recently announced that they would raise prices by 10% in the coming months to combat soaring energy costs and inflation. In an earnings report, OVHcloud told investors that it expects &#8220;electricity costs in 2023 will account for around a mid-to-high-single digit percentage of its revenue, up from mid-single digit in 2022,&#8221; Reuters <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/cloud-services-firm-ovh-sets-growth-target-2023-fy-sales-beat-forecasts-2022-10-26\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In a conversation with TechCrunch, Gartner senior director analyst Ren\u00e9 Buest noted that the era of constantly falling cloud prices has been over for some time. (Google Cloud, for instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/14\/inflation-is-real-google-cloud-raises-its-storage-prices\/\">increased<\/a> the prices of its core services in March independent of rising energy costs.)

Blue&#8217;s troubles: Twitter&#8217;s app has only generated $6.4M in consumer spending to date"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Elon Musk has a new plan to generate revenue for Twitter. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2022\/10\/30\/23431931\/twitter-paid-verification-elon-musk-blue-monthly-subscription\">Reportedly<\/a>, the social media company&#8217;s new owner <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/31\/elon-musk-is-revamping-twitters-verification-system-and-it-might-involve-a-monthly-fee\/\">intends to revamp<\/a> the Twitter Blue premium subscription, currently an optional $4.99 per month for a handful of perks, by upping the price to $19.99 per month while giving subscribers the coveted verification badge. While this plan <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/31\/elon-musk-pay-verified-twitter-misinformation\/\">is problematic for a number of reasons<\/a> &#8212; buying verification devalues it, removing verification from existing users who can&#8217;t pay, like journalists and various notable figures, will aid the spread of misinformation &#8212; it&#8217;s also worth noting that Twitter Blue as it stands today has not been a success. The subscription itself is certainly due for a revamp &#8212; just not a completely misguided, ill-thought-out revamp like this.<\/p>\n<p>Launched <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/03\/twitter-launches-its-premium-subscription-twitter-blue-initially-in-canada-and-australia\/\">in June 2021<\/a>, initially in Canada and Australia, before <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/09\/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set\/\">expanding<\/a> to the U.S. and New Zealand that November, Twitter Blue was meant to help the social media platform diversify its revenue and reduce its reliance on advertisers, who today account for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/10\/28\/technology\/musk-twitter-advertisers-general-motors.html\">more than 90%<\/a> of Twitter&#8217;s total revenue. The idea with Blue has been to entice Twitter&#8217;s heaviest users &#8212; its power users &#8212; to pay a small monthly fee in order to gain access to a handful of exclusive features such as tools to organize bookmarks, the ability to read news articles without ads, custom icons and navigation, early access to new features, a way to quickly fix a typo, and most recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/03\/twitters-edit-button-is-rolling-out-to-blue-subscribers-in-canada-australia-and-new-zealand\/\">the long-awaited Edit button<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But so far, none of these options have offered a strong enough incentive to generate significant revenue for Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>If anything, Twitter users believe the Edit button should be a feature of the site itself, not an exclusive, paid-only option. And they&#8217;ve protested this decision by collectively not jumping to sign up for Twitter Blue, app store data indicates.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, Twitter has oddly chosen at times to roll out new, in-demand features to non-subscribers first instead of to Twitter Blue&#8217;s paying customer base, as had been promised. For example, when Twitter this month <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/03\/twitter-expands-access-to-its-experimental-status-feature-but-not-to-its-paid-subscribers\/\">expanded access to its experimental Status feature<\/a>, which lets users tag tweets with a sentiment like &#8220;Don&#8217;t @ me,&#8221; &#8220;spoiler alert,&#8221; &#8220;breaking news,&#8221; and more, it didn&#8217;t include the option in Twitter Blue.<\/p>\n<p>That meant paid Twitter users had to watch as a random subset of Twitter&#8217;s user base, including many free users, got to play with a fun, new addition to Twitter they couldn&#8217;t use. A truly bizarre choice on the company&#8217;s part, and one that misunderstands what its power users value.<\/p>\n<p>The lack of demand for Twitter Blue can be seen in the insignificant amount of revenue it&#8217;s managed to pull in to date.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>According to data from app intelligence firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sensortower.com\">Sensor Tower,<\/a> Twitter&#8217;s mobile app has only seen approximately $6.4 million in worldwide consumer spending to date. By comparison, Twitter&#8217;s annual revenue in 2021 was $5.08 billion. In the<a href=\"https:\/\/s22.q4cdn.com\/826641620\/files\/doc_financials\/2022\/q2\/Final_Q2'22_Earnings_Release.pdf\"> second quarter<\/a> of this year, Twitter generated $1.18 billion in revenue, $1.08 billion of which was from advertising. (Twitter also generates revenue from data licensing and other sources, so even the difference between these two figures can&#8217;t be chalked up to subscriptions alone).<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s impossible to tell from third-party data <em>exactly<\/em> how much consumer spending in the Twitter app was directed at Twitter Blue specifically, as Twitter also offered in-app purchases for &#8220;Ticketed Spaces&#8221; &#8212; that is, paid entry into a special event as a part of Twitter&#8217;s live audio streaming product. But we can estimate that Ticketed Spaces revenue was only a small fraction of that total, if anything at all, as Twitter found that feature had seen so little adoption it decided to shut it down last month, Twitter recently confirmed to TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>Sensor Tower additionally noted that the Twitter Blue monthly subscription was the top in-app purchase, indicating that likely the bulk of the in-app consumer spending comes from Blue subscribers, not those paying for the virtually unused Ticketed Spaces feature.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter Blue&#8217;s lack of traction isn&#8217;t just a symptom of an app with a small user base. Year to date, the company has seen 153 million worldwide installs, slightly down by 3% over the 158 million seen during the same period last year (Jan. 1 through Oct. 27), Sensor Tower said. As of Q2 2022, Twitter had 237.8 million monetizable daily active users (mDAUs), it said during earnings.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, another social app with a similar subscription model is far outpacing Twitter Blue, despite being live for only a few months.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/29\/snapchat-officially-introduces-its-paid-subscription-at-3-99-per-month\/\">launched its first premium subscription offering this year with Snapchat+<\/a>. Like Twitter Blue, the $3.99 per month Snapchat+ subscription (cheaper than Blue) is aimed at the app&#8217;s power users and offers its own set of exclusive perks. Snapchat+ subscribers today can change the app icon, see who rewatched their Stories, pin someone as their &#8216;Best Friend,&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/20\/snapchat-expands-its-paid-subscription-with-story-expiration-controls-custom-sounds-and-more\/\">change the visibility duration of their Stories<\/a>, use custom notification sounds, and much more. It&#8217;s a good comp for how a social subscription offering could work, if fairly successful.<\/p>\n<p>As of <a href=\"https:\/\/s25.q4cdn.com\/442043304\/files\/doc_financials\/2022\/q3\/Snap-Inc.-Q3-2022-Press-Release-(10.20.2022).pdf\">Q3 2022<\/a>, Snapchat+ reached over 1.5 million paying subscribers across more than 170 countries, the company said.<\/p>\n<p>Following its June 29, 2022 launch, Sensor Tower data indicates Snapchat+ has generated a little more than $28 million in worldwide consumer spending. It&#8217;s also attracting users who are willing to commit to paying for longer periods of time. The Snapchat+ monthly subscription is the top in-app purchase, but the second most popular option is the annual subscription, the firm noted.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, in roughly 4 months&#8217; time, Snapchat+ pulled in more than quadruple the revenue that Twitter Blue has over a 17-month period. Even accounting for the fact that Snapchat has 363 million daily active users to Twitter&#8217;s 237.8 million (though yes, a slightly different metric as Twitter only counts users who can view its ads &#8212; mDAUs, not DAUs), it&#8217;s clear that Twitter Blue has not been a smashing success.<\/p>\n<p>So, in a sense, Musk would not be wrong to suggest that Twitter Blue needs a makeover.<\/p>\n<p>But his decision to essentially burn both Twitter Blue and Twitter&#8217;s verification system to the ground and turn into a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2011\/10\/26\/nobody-gives-a-damn-about-your-klout-score\/\">cringe-worthy Klout score<\/a> for people with money to show off their wealth &#8212; a modern-day <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2008\/08\/06\/i-am-rich-iphone-app-costs-1000\/\">&#8220;I Am Rich&#8221; app,<\/a> we&#8217;d argue &#8212; is such a ridiculous, ill-conceived notion that&#8217;s it&#8217;s almost comical at this point.<\/p>\n<p>There are many, many things that Twitter users may actually pay for, but verification, much like the Edit button, isn&#8217;t among them.<\/p>\n<p>If fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Jason\/status\/1586918111936118784\">a poll posted by investor Jason Calacanis<\/a> &#8212; now one of the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MikeIsaac\/status\/1586798226593546240\">Twitter war room&#8221; members<\/a> &#8212; demonstrates this. At over 1 million votes and counting, 81% of respondents said they wouldn&#8217;t pay anything at all for verification. Around 11% would pay the same as some do now for Blue &#8212; $5\/month. (Musk replied &#8220;interesting&#8221; to the poll&#8217;s results, which hopefully means he&#8217;ll reconsider his disastrous decision to up Blue&#8217;s price to $20 per month at a time when people can&#8217;t even afford to put gas in their cars.)<\/p>\n<p>In short, there are things that Twitter, as a service, should simply offer to its users and things that should be paid additions. Verification should not be among the paid features, nor should basic functionality, like the ability to edit a post. Perhaps paying to fast-track a verification request would be useful to some as a standalone in-app purchase. But by default, verification makes Twitter functional. It shouldn&#8217;t be a paid perk.<\/p>\n<p>What Twitter users may actually pay for are things they would see as a value-add, like the ability to remove ads from the site by paying for a subscription instead &#8212; much like streaming services offer today.<\/p>\n<p>Users may also consider a subscription if it removed paywalls from a majority of top news publishers&#8217; sites, not just a handful of partners, or if it opened up more networking opportunities, similar to how only paid subscribers on LinkedIn can access users&#8217; inboxes without first being connected. Some brands might pay to be a verified business or for additional marketing tools. Users and creators might pay for better analytics and advanced search capabilities, including searching across your own followers.<\/p>\n<p>But $20 per month &#8212; <em>more than Netflix!<\/em> &#8212; to show you have money to burn for a blue checkmark?

The company told TechCrunch that four men were implanted with ADAM at a hospital in Australia, using a minimally invasive, no-scalpel approach, with ADAM being injected using a patent-pending delivery device.<\/p>\n<p>The procedure marks the first patient implanted in \u201cThe ADAM Study,\u201d which is being conducted under Human Research Ethics Committee approval. The ADAM Study is assessing the safety of the ADAM Hydrogel, while monitoring the semen parameters of the study subjects over three years.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Contraline has the potential to fundamentally change the market for contraception,&#8221; said Cathy Friedman, executive venture partner at GV. &#8220;We look forward to working with the team as they continue developing a long-acting, reversible male contraceptive that empowers more people with more choices over family planning.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Contraline&#8217;s study in Australia continues, and its next, longer-term goal is to run a second study with a larger group of patients in the United States.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The cervix industry has had implants to prevent pregnancy since the late 1960s, but there hasn&#8217;t exactly been stiff competition to slow down the fallopian swim team at its source.

Calacanis, per the leaked texts, laid out a five-part plan to Musk, including the concept of a &#8220;membership team,&#8221; which would &#8220;remove bots while getting users to pay for &#8216;real name membership.'&#8221; He also complained that &#8220;no one is setting priorities ruthlessly&#8221; at Twitter, and that &#8220;12,000 people are working on whatever they want.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Musk responded, &#8220;Want to be a strategic advisor to Twitter if this works out?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The desire to &#8220;authenticate all humans&#8221; has been part of Musk&#8217;s plan since he initially made his takeover bid. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/26\/elon-musk-twitter-privacy\/\">Potential security flaws<\/a> aside, this plan ignores the fundamental difference between verifying someone&#8217;s identity, and giving someone a blue check to denote that they are who they say they are.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou could easily clean up bots and spam and make the service viable for many more users \u2014 removing bots and spam is a lot less complicated than what the Tesla self driving team is doing,\u201d Calacanis texted Musk. \u201cAnd why should blue check marks be limited to the elite, press and celebrities? How is that democratic?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Musk and his buddies view this plan as a way to get people to actually give Twitter money. But by monetizing a symbol that currently has value, they will ultimately remove all of that existing value.<\/p>\n<p>Blue checks exist on social platforms as a means of combating misinformation. Currently, if someone makes a fake account pretending to be a world leader, journalist or celebrity, it&#8217;s easy to tell it&#8217;s a fake if the account doesn&#8217;t have a blue check. But under this newly proposed system, there&#8217;s not much incentive to pay the $20 per month to stay verified, especially since the once-coveted symbol would be available to anyone willing to pay. It&#8217;s quite possible that bad actors trying to pose as journalists to spread fake news would be more incentivized to pay the $20 than actual journalists.<\/p>\n<p>The Chief Twit doesn&#8217;t seem to care very much about the dangers of misinformation, though. Just this weekend, Musk tweeted (and then deleted) a fraudulent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/americas\/crime\/elon-musk-paul-pelosi-attack-hillary-clinton-b2213757.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conspiracy theory<\/a> about the attack on Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s husband.<\/p>\n<p>Another avenue for this feature could be to charge corporations like Netflix or Steak-umm (which has a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/steak_umm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great Twitter presence<\/a>) to be verified. Corporate clients are likely more willing than a local nonprofit newsroom to drop $20 a month per account to prove legitimacy. Yet this still doesn&#8217;t solve the misinformation issue, and if anything, it pressures companies into buying a product that they&#8217;ve gotten free for years in order to prevent a possible PR problem.<\/p>\n<p>For now, it doesn&#8217;t seem like Twitter users are particularly enthusiastic about this plan. Calacanis posted a poll asking how much people would pay to be verified, and at the time of publication, about 81% of more than a million respondents said that they would not pay. But as our own Ivan Mehta <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/31\/elon-musk-is-revamping-twitters-verification-system-and-it-might-involve-a-monthly-fee\/\">wrote<\/a> earlier, &#8220;<span style=\"letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;\">Seven days is a long time in Elonverse and he might come up with a different verification tactic altogether.&#8221; Hopefully, that plan is a bit more thought-through than this one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"mqC74RFFcN\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/31\/elon-musk-is-revamping-twitters-verification-system-and-it-might-involve-a-monthly-fee\/\">Elon Musk is revamping Twitter\u2019s verification system \u2014 and it might involve a monthly fee<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Elon Musk is revamping Twitter\u2019s verification system \u2014 and it might involve a monthly fee&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/31\/elon-musk-is-revamping-twitters-verification-system-and-it-might-involve-a-monthly-fee\/embed\/#?secret=DirfhCO098#?secret=mqC74RFFcN\" data-secret=\"mqC74RFFcN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"BjgUNfLmx6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/29\/elon-musk-texts-discovery-twitter\/\">Here are some of the cringiest revelations in the Elon Musk text dump<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Here are some of the cringiest revelations in the Elon Musk text dump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/29\/elon-musk-texts-discovery-twitter\/embed\/#?secret=zZK5Bey0eK#?secret=BjgUNfLmx6\" data-secret=\"BjgUNfLmx6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/elon-buys-twitter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/musk-buys-twitter-banner.jpg\" alt=\"Read more about Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter on TechCrunch\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s been less than a week since Elon Musk became &#8220;Chief Twit&#8221; at Twitter and he has already come up with ideas that are stupider than walking into HQ with a sink.

It&#8217;s clear from their recent earnings call that analysts would rather the company and Zuckerberg spend their time and focus on making the most of what it has already achieved in contemporary social media \u2014 which does seem smart even if that ends up being an exercise in managing a long decline into irrelevancy. A drawn out and properly run death is often a more profitable enterprise than a massively costly shift on focus on an unproven technology like VR, after all.<\/p>\n<p>Meta is also very experienced and arguably quite good at one thing in particular: Cloning the features of its its rivals. That&#8217;s not to say it always gets this right \u2014 it&#8217;s struggling right not to capture the essence of what makes TikTok so appealing to its users, and has encountered reversals when it tried to replicate features like its organic out-of-network discovery model in Instagram. Despite reversals, however, Meta has repeated proven determined and resilient when it comes to building, testing and launching features that give its rivals an edge (Stories and Snap being probably the stickiest and most product-transforming example of this).<\/p>\n<p>Twitter, meanwhile, is facing what will undoubtedly become an existential crisis following Elon Musk&#8217;s successful (if also reluctant) $44 billion leveraged buyout. Over the weekend immediately following the deal close, reports emerged that Musk had assembled a motley crew of hangers-on and moneyed pals to help advise his overhaul of the company. He&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/31\/elon-musk-vine-reboot-poll\/\">toying with bringing back proto-TikTok video platform Vine<\/a>, and he&#8217;s also thinking about <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/31\/elon-musk-is-revamping-twitters-verification-system-and-it-might-involve-a-monthly-fee\/\">making people pay for the blue check that &#8216;verifies&#8217; users on the network<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>People are already considering what the alternatives are if Twitter ceases to serve the function that arguably drives much of its use right now: Acting as a kind of town square, and one where media personalities in particular feel they can get the attention of, and engage in conversation with, their peers, and with influential personalities who have the ability to amplify their voices.<\/p>\n<p>Existing alternatives including Mastodon are seeing increases in user interest in the wake of the Twitter deal closing, but they&#8217;re unlikely to reach any kind of critical mass longterm. Tumblr is a dark horse candidate for occupying the space that Twitter once did, especially if it can achieve current owner Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s goal of it becoming both the distribution network and the content platform for media.<\/p>\n<p>But Meta, with its existing social pedigree and network dynamics, likely has the best chance of being able to replicate what led to Twitter building the user base it currently enjoys \u2013 and also growing that, while turning it into a money-making enterprise at the same time.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Facebook hasn&#8217;t really tried to replicate Twitter, but Zuckerberg did offer $500 million to take over the network in its infancy in 2008. You could argue that its sub-400 million userbase (of which only around half are considered &#8216;daily active users&#8217;) is beneath the notice of a company like Meta, which has nearly 2 billion daily active users on Facebook and 1.2 billion monthly active users on Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter, however, is unique in the makeup of its network and most-followed users, which comprise billionaires, politicians and powerful voices in media. It&#8217;s a desirable audience, and likely one that can be monetized \u2014 particularly by Meta, the company that is arguably the best in history at monetizing digital consumer products .<\/p>\n<p>Building a viable Twitter alternative would, however, mean increasing Meta&#8217;s exposure to the fraught landscape of content moderation \u2014 a landscape Zuckerberg&#8217;s retreat into his legless virtual world seems specifically designed to avoid.<\/p>\n<p>I doubt Zuck has the stomach to spin up a Twitter unencumbered by the mountain of debt now settled firmly on the chest of the current version, but it would be an interesting place for Meta to channel its significant resources that has a lot more historical viability than the metaverse.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While Mark Zuckerberg burns billions at the alter of the metaverse, a much more practical opportunity directly in his company&#8217;s lane could provide much more achievable short-term success: Twitter&#8217;s having an identify crisis under new owner Elon Musk.

NFT exchange OpenSea, led by CEO and co-founder Devin Finzer, emerged as a clear market leader, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/04\/nft-kingpin-opensea-lands-13-3b-valuation-in-300m-raise-from-paradigm-and-coatue\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earning a $13.3B valuation in January<\/a> and controlling an estimated 90% of the overall NFT market.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, it\u2019s been a bumpy ride for NFTs. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/01\/openseas-13b-valuation-doesnt-make-sense-as-nft-trading-volumes-plunge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trading volumes have fallen<\/a> over 90% from their January peak, forcing exchanges, including OpenSea, to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/14\/nft-marketplace-opensea-lays-off-20-percent-of-its-staff-we-have-entered-crypto-winter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conduct steep layoffs<\/a>. And for OpenSea specifically, competition is mounting, as newer entrants such as Magic Eden threaten its dominance and rumors of an OpenSea IPO have fizzled out. Big tech could stifle long-term growth in the space, too, as Apple&#8217;s and Google\u2019s high marketplace fees challenge the idea that NFT trading can ever reach mobile adoption.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of challenges on the horizon, but there\u2019s also tremendous potential for OpenSea to capture long-term growth in the NFT market if it does indeed occur. There are undeniable pockets of excitement in the space, so the question is whether that excitement will be realized and whether OpenSea is well-positioned to capture it.<\/p>\n<p>These are some of the topics we\u2019ll discuss with Finzer onstage at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-crypto-2022\/?&amp;promo=article25&amp;display=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TechCrunch Sessions: Crypto<\/a>. We\u2019ll ask him about what use cases for NFTs he sees the most potential in and will hear about how the company plans to sustain its first-mover advantage and seize new growth opportunities through a bear market.<\/p>\n<p>The event takes place on November 17 in Miami. <strong>Save $150 with early bird pricing<\/strong> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-crypto-2022\/?&amp;promo=article25&amp;display=TRUE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buy your pass<\/a> today, and then join the web3, DeFi and NFT communities to keep up with the ever-evolving and always exciting crypto world.<\/p>\n<p>\t<iframe\n\t\t\tid=\"wpcom-iframe-7262b40f625aa714fa1769781396bea1\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"99%\"\n\t\t\theight=\"1000\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https:\/\/tcprotectedembed.com\/protected-iframe\/7262b40f625aa714fa1769781396bea1\"\n\t\t\tscrolling=\"true\"\n\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\tclass=\"Bizzabo\"\n\t>\n\t<\/iframe>\n\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-7262b40f625aa714fa1769781396bea1')\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-7262b40f625aa714fa1769781396bea1'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, \"https:\\\/\\\/tcprotectedembed.com\" );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\/\/ Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\/\/ Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'tcprotectedembed.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\/\/ Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); \/* compat for infinite scroll *\/ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'DOMContentLoaded', func, false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t<\/script>\n\t<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The NFT market is worth tens of billions of dollars and saw rapid growth throughout the crypto bull run.

As Tusk puts it during the event, he seldom hears startup founders like Vandenberg and Dibbs&#8217; proactive approach to regulations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of what our firm does is we invest but then we take on the regulatory communication challenges of our portfolio companies, and we work on them,&#8221; Tusk said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s because of my and my team&#8217;s background in politics. So the idea of &#8216;Here&#8217;s a company that&#8217;s proactively interested in new forms of regulations.&#8217; That&#8217;s the kind of nerdy stuff my team, and I geek out about, so it was cool to have a founder like Vandenberg, too.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tusk advises startups to answer the following questions when launching into a regulated market.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the laws on the books?<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>It may be that your thing is completely legal, allowed or somewhere gray. So, for example, Bird when we launched Bird, in most markets, we didn&#8217;t ask for permission to come in because it wasn&#8217;t illegal, right? We tried to be nice about it, but electric scooters were banned in Illinois and New York. And we had to pass legislation in Springfield and Albany; once we did that, the scooters came in.<\/p>\n<p>So the first thing is what&#8217;s allowed because you may have a huge problem, you may have no problem or it may be most likely somewhere in the middle.<\/p>\n<h2>Who are you pissing off?<\/h2>\n<p>Who are you going to be fighting with politically? Are you disrupting an entrenched interest? And if so, what&#8217;s their relative political power in that particular jurisdiction that you want to launch in? Or is it whitespace like what [Evan Vandenberg and Dibbs] are doing where no one&#8217;s ever done this stuff before? So the good news is, you don&#8217;t have pushback from the taxis or the casinos. The bad news is that nobody knows what to do.<\/p>\n<p>What relative strengths do you bring to the fight?<\/p>\n<p>For example, with Uber, the way we beat taxis in every market was to marshal our customers and have them directly reach out to their city council member, state senator or mayor and say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t take this thing away from me.&#8217; And because a couple of million people engaged in that for a couple of years, we went everywhere.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>How do you get elected officials on your side?<\/h2>\n<blockquote><p>Elected officials appoint regulators, and 99% of elected officials are desperately self-loathing, insecure people. And 100% of elected officials make every decision solely based on the next election and nothing else&#8230; So if politicians only care about re-election, what do you have to offer them that makes them think that legalizing your product will help them get reelected, or failure to do so will decrease their chance of reelected?<\/p>\n<p>Once you can convey that sentiment to the politician who appoints the regulator, the regulator will be told what to do.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Politician turned venture capitalist Bradley Tusk recently spoke at a TechCrunch Live event on how startups should approach regulation.

energy costs are making the cloud more expensive"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Since winter, around<\/span> the start of the war in Ukraine, energy costs have risen drastically \u2014 particularly in parts of Europe historically dependent on Russian fuel. That&#8217;s impacted data centers, which aren&#8217;t directly reliant on resources like natural gas but which often draw on power grids and backup generators that generate a portion of their electricity using fossil fuels.<\/p>\n<p>According to a July <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aggreko.com\/en-gb\/news\/2022\/noeur-news\/power-struggle-for-data-centres\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report<\/a> from power generation supplier Aggreko, data center operators in the U.K. and Ireland have seen their energy bills increase by as much as 50% over the last three years, with the steepest climbs occurring within the last year. Fifty-eight percent of those in the U.K. said that energy bills have had a &#8220;significant impact&#8221; on their company&#8217;s margins.<\/p>\n<p>It seems inevitable that the energy premium data center operators are being forced to pay will be passed along to customers. Indeed, it&#8217;s already happening.<\/p>\n<p>Way back in November 2021, Manchester-based cloud services provider M247 hiked prices a whopping 161%, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/2021\/11\/04\/m247_price_increases\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blaming<\/a> &#8220;unprecedented times in the European energy markets.&#8221; Cloud providers <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.ovhcloud.com\/ovhcloud-price-adjustments-in-2022-and-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OVHcloud<\/a>, based in France, and <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.hetzner.com\/general\/others\/price-adjustment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hetzner<\/a>, based in Germany, both recently announced that they would raise prices by 10% in the coming months to combat soaring energy costs and inflation. In an earnings report, OVHcloud told investors that it expects &#8220;electricity costs in 2023 will account for around a mid-to-high-single digit percentage of its revenue, up from mid-single digit in 2022,&#8221; Reuters <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/cloud-services-firm-ovh-sets-growth-target-2023-fy-sales-beat-forecasts-2022-10-26\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In a conversation with TechCrunch, Gartner senior director analyst Ren\u00e9 Buest noted that the era of constantly falling cloud prices has been over for some time. (Google Cloud, for instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/14\/inflation-is-real-google-cloud-raises-its-storage-prices\/\">increased<\/a> the prices of its core services in March independent of rising energy costs.) But she agreed that rising costs \u2014 and the associated inflation \u2014 have accelerated the upward cloud pricing trend.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rising energy costs are making cloud services more expensive to operate, particularly in Europe.

vector database can now handle hybrid keyword-semantic search"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">When <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinecone.io\/\">Pinecone<\/a> announced a vector database at the beginning of last year, it was building something that was specifically designed for machine learning and aimed at data scientists. The idea was that you could query this data in a format that machines understand, making it much faster.<\/p>\n<p>Originally this involved semantic searches where users could search based on meaning instead of specific words. It turns out, however, that as people put Pinecone to work, there were use cases where specific keywords mattered, and today the company announced that it\u2019s now possible to conduct searches combining both semantic and keyword searches, what company founder and CEO Edo Liberty calls hybrid search.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;ve conducted a lot of research on this topic and we found that, in fact, hybrid search ends up being better [in many cases]. It&#8217;s better in the sense that if you can combine both semantic search, this is the deep NLP encoding of sentences that gets the context and the meaning and so on, but you can also infuse that with specific keywords\u2026the combination of those two ends up being significantly better,\u201d Liberty told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>In fact he says the two complement each other well, especially in cases where industry-specific terms matter. This could be something like a doctor searching for keywords related to a specific disease. In those cases, the medical context may return better results by combining a question and some specific keywords around a given disease.<\/p>\n<p>He says that the keywords never take precedence over the semantic question the user is asking, but they provide some extra information to help return more meaningful results.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cYou might know exactly what you&#8217;re looking for, and you might be able to provide extra oomph when you make your semantic search keyword-aware \u2013 and that actually helps a lot. So I don&#8217;t want to throw away the good parts of keyword search [by relying completely on semantic search]. I don&#8217;t want the keywords to be in the driver&#8217;s seat, but I don&#8217;t to ignore them completely either,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>As Liberty told us at the time of the company\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/pinecone-announces-28m-series-a-for-purpose-built-database-aimed-at-data-scientists\/\">$28 million Series A<\/a> last year, search has become a big use case for the company:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe predominant use of the vector databases is for search, and search in the broad sense of the word. It\u2019s searching through documents, but you can think about search as information retrieval in general, discovery, recommendation, anomaly detection and so on,\u201d he said at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Pinecone launched in 2019 and has raised $38 million, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/pinecone\">per Crunchbase<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Pinecone announced a vector database at the beginning of last year, it was building something that was specifically designed for machine learning and aimed at data scientists.

work while also managing a business. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toplinepro.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Topline Pro<\/a> wants to take some of that burden off the shoulders of professionals so they can concentrate on customers.<\/p>\n<p>New York-based Topline Pro, formerly ProPhone, does this by leveraging generative artificial intelligence to provide a way for these businesses to get discovered, build trust among customers and generate repeat customers.<\/p>\n<p>The interface creates a custom website with search-engine optimization that can go live the same day. It showcases the professional\u2019s business, including collecting online reviews, scheduling bookings and accepting payments. Meanwhile, the AI generates additional content, including local listings and automating social media content.<\/p>\n<p>Nick Ornitz, co-founder and CEO, started the company with Shannon Kay after meeting in business school. Inspiration for Topline Pro came from Ornitz\u2019s siblings who are among the 5 million people running service-based companies, from landscaping to painting to cleaning and general contracting. In talking with them and home improvement retailers that he previously worked with, he and Kay realized just how much these businesses were relying on pen and paper.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2433249\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2433249\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2433249 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screen-Shot-2022-10-26-at-8.46.53-AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"Shannon Kay, Nick Ornitz, Topline Pro\" width=\"680\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screen-Shot-2022-10-26-at-8.46.53-AM.png 1908w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screen-Shot-2022-10-26-at-8.46.53-AM.png?resize=150,125 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screen-Shot-2022-10-26-at-8.46.53-AM.png?resize=300,249 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screen-Shot-2022-10-26-at-8.46.53-AM.png?resize=768,638 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screen-Shot-2022-10-26-at-8.46.53-AM.png?resize=680,565 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screen-Shot-2022-10-26-at-8.46.53-AM.png?resize=1536,1275 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screen-Shot-2022-10-26-at-8.46.53-AM.png?resize=1200,996 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Screen-Shot-2022-10-26-at-8.46.53-AM.png?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2433249\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Topline Pro co-founders Shannon Kay and Nick Ornitz. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Topline Pro<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you talk to a homeowner they were disappointed or frustrated by the experience and when you talk to the business owner, they&#8217;re trying their best to do the work, but also run the business,\u201d Ornitz told TechCrunch. \u201cThat just seemed like a really big opportunity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Their initial idea, then called ProPhone, connected plumbers with homeowners over video chat. The co-founders even went through Y Combinator as part of the Winter 2021 batch. However, while accelerating the business, many of ProPhone\u2019s plumber customers were saying that they like the video calls, but needed more jobs and they didn\u2019t know how to grow their business beyond word-of-mouth.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s when Ornitz and Kay pivoted to Topline Pro. They launched the current subscription product, which starts at $75 per month, in January of 2022. In 10 months, the company has generated more than $25 million in job requests across more than 1,000 monthly subscriber businesses in nearly all 50 states, Ornitz said.<\/p>\n<p>Topline is not alone in helping professionals manage their businesses digitally. In fact, this is becoming a hot area for startups to play in and for investors to flock. For example, in July, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/06\/finli-service-business-payment-management\/\">Finli<\/a>, which developed a mobile-first payment management system for businesses, raised $6 million.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"3ILsBNBmy7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/06\/finli-service-business-payment-management\/\">Finli puts service-based business payment management in the palm of your hand<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Finli puts service-based business payment management in the palm of your hand&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/06\/finli-service-business-payment-management\/embed\/#?secret=KLfbhdfJii#?secret=3ILsBNBmy7\" data-secret=\"3ILsBNBmy7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/21\/zuper-secures-13m-to-take-the-sting-out-of-home-repairs\/\">Zuper<\/a>, a provider of productivity tools for field service management and customer engagement, raised $13 million.

It is also not a marketplace and so its customers are able to be discovered directly by homeowners online so that they can own the relationships without that middle layer.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, today Topline Pro announced $5 million in seed funding, led by Bonfire Ventures, and including TMV, BBG Ventures and a group of angel investors, like Squire co-founder Songe LaRon.<\/p>\n<p>Plans for the new capital include developing additional applications for the generative AI; for example, applications that help professionals with their SEO, content and blog updates as well as helping pros with their marketing. Ornitz also expects to add to the company\u2019s 12 employees in the areas of engineering, product and customer success.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure that the pro is being discovered by as many people as possible,\u201d he added. \u201cOnce you&#8217;ve found that pro we want to make sure that the homeowner has an easier process to book with them and also pay with them.

id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">As the head<\/span> of startup pipeline at Techstars, I\u2019ve been getting on calls with founders, attending events, speaking on stages like TechCrunch\u2019s Disrupt and hosting countless Twitter Spaces. Each time, I\u2019ve been telling founders why they should join an accelerator.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I am changing things up and going to lay out six reasons you shouldn&#8217;t join an accelerator.<\/p>\n<h2>If you only need funding<\/h2>\n<p>You&#8217;re better off going to VCs, angel investors, crowdfunding, applying for grants or seeking venture debt. Accelerators usually take more (equity), because they provide more than just money. They give you funding and fundraising opportunities, mentorship and networks, workshops and usually a place to work. If you don\u2019t need any of that, then you don\u2019t need an accelerator.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tAccelerators are great because they&#8217;re a forcing mechanism to reach your most desired outcome by the end of the program, but no one is going to drag you out of bed every morning.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that funding will solve your money problems, but it won&#8217;t solve everything else. You\u2019ll still need to figure out how to acquire customers, find the best talent, build an incredible product, assemble a great advisory board and get to product-market fit.<\/p>\n<p>Do you just need funding? Lucky you. For crowdfunding, you can\u2019t go wrong with <a href=\"http:\/\/republic.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Republic<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/wefunder.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WeFunder<\/a>. For venture debt options, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.svb.com\/landing-pages\/venture-debt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SVB<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/mercury.com\/venture-debt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercury<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opengrants.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenGrants<\/a> for, well, grants.<\/p>\n<h2>To do customer development<\/h2>\n<p>Customer development, also known as customer discovery or idea validation, is the notion of validating your startup idea. You don&#8217;t need an accelerator to tell you to talk to your customers. You should be doing it anyway. Otherwise, why are you building the thing you want to build?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, many accelerators accept companies at the idea stage, but it\u2019s usually on the premise that primary or secondary research has been conducted to show you\u2019re building something people have said they would use and\/or pay for.<div

And, if you&#8217;re contract management software company <a href=\"http:\/\/icertis.com\">Icertis<\/a>, it&#8217;s payday. After raising $115 million in 2019, Icertis today secured $150 million &#8212; $75 million in convertible debt and a $75 million revolving credit facility &#8212; in a combined tranche from Silicon Valley Bank that brings the company&#8217;s total capital raised to $520 million.<\/p>\n<p>By going the debt route, Icertis avoids having to answer the tricky question of valuation in an especially challenging economic environment. (Icertis was valued at $2.8 billion as of March 2021 and <a href=\"https:\/\/inc42.com\/buzz\/saas-giant-sap-backs-contract-intelligence-startup-icertis-valuation-likely-to-touch-5-bn\/\">reportedly<\/a> as high as $5 billion earlier this year, but <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/18\/why-do-startup-valuations-go-down-when-interest-rates-go-up\/\">valuations<\/a> in tech are on a steep downswing.) Convertible debt allows Icertis to pay its loan obligation with equity or stocks, while the credit facility lets it borrow and repay on an ongoing basis.<\/p>\n<p>CEO Samir Bodas was rather vague about the plans for the new cash, but told TechCrunch in an interview that it would involve &#8220;accelerating the application of transformational technologies like artificial intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning and blockchain to deliver material, unique, and consequential value to customers.&#8221; That&#8217;s all rather ambitious (and, truth be told, a little buzzwordy), but Bodas asserted that Icertis is well-positioned to fend off rival startups in the cutthroat contract management space.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Industry analysts like Gartner and Forrester refer to our category as contract lifecycle management (CLM), but Icertis differentiates from traditional CLM vendors,&#8221; Bodas said. &#8220;We not only deliver efficiencies in contract creation and negotiation, but we use AI and natural language processing to structure contract information into on-demand data and connect that data to operational systems &#8230; to automate processes, maximize contract value and ensure compliance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2009 by Bodas (a veteran of Microsoft and Aztecsoft) and Monish Darda (previously an executive at BladLogic), Icertis provides cloud-hosted tools for managing procurement, sales and corporate contracts &#8212; including tools that can read and analyze contracts to deliver risk management reports and automatic obligation tracking. The platform systemizes contracts and the associated documentation, extracting data like contact information and clauses to figure out contractual commitments and monitor them to ensure compliance.<\/p>\n<p>Ingested contracts can be used to model commercial relationships in Icertis, letting users identify contracts missing clauses necessary to complying with regulations like GDPR. Bodas claims the AI systems powering this and other features of the Icertis platform are among the most capable of their kind, able to process over 7,000 different types of contracts across 11 verticals.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2433684\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2433684\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2433684\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/search-save.webp\" alt=\"Icertis\" width=\"1024\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/search-save.webp 1914w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/search-save.webp?resize=150,85 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/search-save.webp?resize=300,170 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/search-save.webp?resize=768,436 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/search-save.webp?resize=680,386 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/search-save.webp?resize=1536,872 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/search-save.webp?resize=1200,682 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/search-save.webp?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2433684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Icertis&#8217; contract management software, which runs in the cloud.<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We are forging and leading a new category of technology &#8212; contract intelligence &#8212; which uses AI to automate processes and deliver insights with structured, connected contract data to digitally memorialize the purpose of every commercial relationship and ensure the intent of those agreements is fully realized,&#8221; Bodas said.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a bold statement. But it&#8217;s true Bellevue, Washington-based Icertis is already one of the larger and more successful contract management software vendors to emerge in recent years. Bodas says that the company exited 2021 with an annual recurring revenue north of $100 million and recently surpassed $200 million in recurring revenue. He declined to disclose the size of Icertis&#8217; customer base, but he noted that current clients include Microsoft, Boeing, Google, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Sanofi, Mercedes-Benz and Qantas and unnamed public sector agencies.<\/p>\n<p>This year, Icertis announced a partnership with SAP to make Icertis the CLM solution of choice for SAP customers. (Alongside Softbank, SAP holds a minority stake in Icertis.) Bodas says it&#8217;ll create a contract management &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; for SAP clients through integrations with SAP solutions like Ariba, Fieldglass, S\/4HANA and SuccessFactors.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In this economic downturn, we believe contracts, which govern every dollar in and out of the enterprise, will emerge as the go-to asset because they are an untapped source of invaluable business value to reduce costs, manage risk, ensure compliance and drive revenue,&#8221; Bodas said. &#8220;We are bullish that contract intelligence will emerge from this downturn as the fifth system of record in the enterprise, and that Icertis is positioned to lead it for the long term.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Investors see <a href=\"https:\/\/news.bloomberglaw.com\/business-and-practice\/investors-see-promise-in-contract-management-legal-technology\">promise<\/a> in contract management legal technology for procurement, sales, finance, legal and HR like Icertis&#8217; &#8212; perhaps because of the enormous addressable market. The contract management lifecycle market is expected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $2.9 billion by 2024, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketsandmarkets.com\/Market-Reports\/contract-management-software-market-89717094.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according<\/a> to Markets and Markets.<\/p>\n<p>The early adoption metrics certainly have been promising, with one <a href=\"https:\/\/news.bloomberglaw.com\/bloomberg-law-analysis\/analysis-legal-tech-could-aid-lawyer-well-being\">recent<\/a> Bloomberg Law survey showing that more than half of in-house lawyers were using contract management programs in 2020. Bodas says that Icertis&#8217; platform alone has handled more than 10 million contracts worth over $1 trillion in more than 40 languages and over 90 countries<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Contracts are an invaluable source of original data &#8212; documenting and governing the entitlements and obligations between a company and its suppliers, customers, and employees. In other words, contracts provide a single source of truth for commercial relationships,&#8221; Bodas said. He gave an example: &#8220;Recently, customers have been turning to Icertis to help them navigate inflation as best they can. Do their contracts have clauses that enable them to adjust prices in the event of inflation, how often can they raise prices, and by how much? We deliver these insights instantly, so every entitlement within a company\u2019s contracts can be realized for maximum value.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Among Icertis&#8217; competitors are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/17\/contractpodai\/\">ContractPodAI<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/10\/sirionlabs-lands-85m-to-inject-contract-management-with-automation\/\">SirionLabs<\/a>, which raised $55 million in July and $85 million in May, respectively, for their automation-fueled contract management software. Another formidable rival is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/04\/linksquares-benefits-from-the-legal-tech-boom-with-a-fresh-100m\/\">LinkSquares<\/a>, which landed $100 million in April to grow its platform that combines legal analysis with contract lifecycle capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, Icertis dwarfs them in size, with more than 2,000 employees spread across its offices in New Jersey, Chicago and elsewhere.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s Halloween.

for another large seller Cloudtail<\/a> following allegations from retailers that some sellers received preferential treatment.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon and Patni Group-owned Zodiac said in a statement that they have agreed to renew their joint venture, called Frontizo Business Services, but have decided that Appario Retail will \u201ccease to be a seller\u201d on Amazon India within the next 12 months.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe partners will continue to explore new business opportunities, including helping businesses across India to scale up their online presence,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson in India told TechCrunch in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon did not say why it was delisting Appario, but the move follows a growing scrutiny on its owned sellers. India\u2019s antitrust body launched raids on Appario and Cloudtail earlier this year following accusations of competition law violations, Reuters <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/india\/india-launches-antitrust-raids-amazon-sellers-cloudtail-appario-sources-2022-04-28\/\">reported<\/a> in April.<\/p>\n<p>A Reuters investigation last year showed that Amazon had <a href=\"https:\/\/reut.rs\/3rTWXxi\">given preferential treatment for years<\/a> to a small group of sellers on its platform and used them to bypass Indian laws. The outlet&#8217;s investigation also showed that Amazon had for years helped these sellers with discounted fees.<\/p>\n<p>The investigation found that about 35 of Amazon\u2019s more than 400,000 sellers in India in 2019 accounted for around two-thirds of sales on its India website. Of that figure, two sellers, Cloudtail and Appario, contributed 35% of the platform\u2019s sales.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon, which has denied accusations that it gives any seller preferential treatment, cut ties with Cloudtail last year.<\/p>\n<p>India&#8217;s Supreme Court last year ruled that Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart must face antitrust investigations ordered against them in the country.<\/p>\n<p>The Indian watchdog \u2014 the Competition Commission of India \u2014 ordered an investigation into the firms in 2020 for allegedly promoting select sellers (those in which they own a stake) on their e-commerce platforms and using business practices that stifle competition.<\/p>\n<p>Long-standing laws in India restrict Amazon and other e-commerce firms from holding inventory or selling items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.<\/p>\n<p>India got around to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/27\/amazon-walmart-india-e-commerce-restrictions\/\">fixing this loophole in late 2018<\/a> in a move that was widely seen as the biggest blowback to the American firm in the country at the time. Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart scrambled to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/01\/amazon-flipkart-india-law\/\">delist hundreds of thousands of items<\/a> from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/tech\/technology\/mini-cloudtails-mushroom-on-amazon-after-largest-seller-shuts-down\/articleshow\/93560044.cms\">scathing report in August<\/a>, Indian newspaper The Economic Times found that a group of new sellers run by former executives of Cloudtail and Appario have mushroomed in the country and are listed on the Amazon marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>India is a key overseas market for Amazon, which has invested over $6.5 billion in the South Asian market. But it continues to lag its chief rival Flipkart in the country on several\u00a0metrics and is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/31\/amazon-facing-unfavorable-regulatory-environment-in-india-struggles-to-expand\/\">struggling to make inroads in smaller Indian cities and towns<\/a>, according to a report by investment firm Sanford C.

Sure, the autonomous vehicle industry is still frontier tech that is years, even decades, away from becoming a product used daily by most consumers. Profits, hell even revenue, are distant goals.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, Argo&#8217;s demise did feel unexpected, largely because it had deep-pocketed backers like Ford and VW ($2 billion in cash and $1.6 billion in value of taking over VW&#8217;s Autonomous Intelligent Driving subsidiary), several high-profile partners with active pilot programs, a large workforce of top talent and a presence in multiple cities.<\/p>\n<p>The work culture wasn&#8217;t toxic, based on accounts from numerous insiders at different levels of the startup. It was a company widely respected and considered one of a handful of companies poised with the talent, backing and tech to actually pull off the commercialization of AVs.<\/p>\n<p>So why did Argo die? Did the founders or its backers make some fatal flaw along the way? Or is it a larger systemic problem with the technology itself?<\/p>\n<p>As I learn more about this (and I continue to dig), it seems it is a combination of a few factors, including Ford and VW deciding to prioritize near-term profits gleaned from advanced deriver assistance systems over a still-in-the-works technology that neither company had actually figured out a business model for. (or at least one guaranteed to be profitable)<\/p>\n<p>Argo apparently was able to find some new backers (Ford said in its earnings call that Argo couldn&#8217;t find fresh outside investment.) But finding capital wasn&#8217;t the only problem. The terms of any new investor would have to be agreed upon by Ford and VW. I have received varying accounts on the health of that relationship.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch editor Darrell Etherington makes the argument that this proves self-driving cars <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/27\/self-driving-cars-arent-going-to-happen\/\">are not coming anytime soon<\/a>. Cruise co-founder and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kvogt\/status\/1586390902830149632?s=20&amp;t=OJG8CdslDq8p_CR8Tm_J0g\">Kyle Vogt responded<\/a> with some light trolling on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson also piped up with an <a href=\"https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001828108-22-000118\/october272022dashboard.htm\">AV-industry-is-not-doomed message<\/a>. &#8220;This is not a signal that a future with self-driving technology isn&#8217;t real or imminent. In fact, it&#8217;s quite the opposite,&#8221; he wrote, noting Waymo&#8217;s expansion of a robotaxi fleet to LA and Cruise charging for driverless rides in San Francisco. Urmson also provided an update on Aurora&#8217;s focus on self-driving trucks.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t believe the AV industry is dead. I do see \u2014 and have for two years now \u2014 consolidation, tightening capital markets and a shift in priorities from automakers, which were once some of the biggest cheerleaders and backers of AVs. That makes a tough rough even bumpier. And for now, that shuts out a lot of startups.<\/p>\n<p>It would be a bit simplistic to say &#8220;it&#8217;s the profits, stupid.&#8221; But that&#8217;s not entirely isn&#8217;t wrong either.<\/p>\n<p>What do you, dear reader, think?<\/p>\n<h2>Deal of the week<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1894192 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png\" alt=\"the station scooter1a\" width=\"1600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=150,38 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=300,75 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=768,192 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=680,170 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=1200,301 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>On the day the Argo AI news dropped, <strong>Mobileye<\/strong> made its official debut. The success of the IPO \u2014 the third largest this year \u2014 was seen by many as a validation of Ford and VW&#8217;s decision to shutdown Argo. The takeaway was that advanced driver assistance systems, not AV tech, is the real future (at least in terms of revenue and profits).<\/p>\n<p>Mobileye was able to price 41 million shares at $21 and above its initial range, raising $861 million. General Atlantic agreed to buy an additional $100 million of shares in a private placement. Investors seemed ready to pile in and helped shares pop and close nearly 30% above the IPO price.<\/p>\n<p>I spoke to Mobileye founder and CEO Amnon Shashua on the big day. (Look for a longer piece this week.)<\/p>\n<p>A couple of quick takeaways from Dr. Shashua:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Things have changed and became more and more nuanced. You know, five years ago we&#8217;d be talking about driving assist and then robotaxis as kind of two separate domains. We gradually built a product portfolio that bridges the spectrum between driving assist and robotaxis.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That bridge, a technology called <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.intel.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2020\/09\/supervision-product-brief.pdf\">Mobileye Supervision<\/a>, is the critical foundation of the company&#8217;s future. This technology isn&#8217;t looming in the distant future either. The system, which includes 11 cameras around the car that feeds data into Mobileye&#8217;s system on chips, is on 50,000 vehicles in China. Shashua told me they started in China because the country is &#8220;more tech forward and is moving faster than anyone else.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>AM Batteries<\/strong>, a Boston-based company that has developed lithium-ion dry-electrode technology, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20221025005264\/en\/AM-Batteries-AMB-Secures-25M-Series-A-Financing-to-Scale-Manufacturing-of-Novel-Lithium-Ion-Dry-Electrode-Technology\">raised $25 million<\/a> in Series A round led by Anzu Partners.

For the mission, SpaceX will attempt to directly inject two U.S. Space Force spacecraft to geosynchronous orbit. The payload includes TETRA-1, a microsatellite developed by Boeing subsidiary Millennium Space Systems, which the company describes as a spacecraft created for \u201cvarious prototype missions\u201d in an around GEO. The other spacecraft is classified.<\/p>\n<p>While the Space Force originally intended to launch the USSF-44 mission in late 2020, it was repeatedly delayed due to payload readiness issues.<\/p>\n<p>Falcon Heavy is the most powerful rocket currently in operation, and it\u2019s only flown three times, the last of which took place in June 2019. Its maiden launch, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/06\/watch-the-live-feed-from-spacexs-roadster-driving-starman-in-space\/\">carried a Tesla Roadster<\/a> (and dummy driver) to orbit, is a particularly notable chapter in SpaceX history.<\/p>\n<p>The rocket is made up of a trio of Falcon 9 boosters, the very same ones that now launch at least once a week. The whopping 27 Merlin engines together produce around 5 million pounds of thrust. A Falcon 9 second stage and payload fairing is attached to the central booster.<\/p>\n<p>This will be the first launch for all three boosters as well as the upper stage and fairing. SpaceX shared a photo last week of the three first stages in the hangar at Kennedy Space Center.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2432850\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2432850\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2432850\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4A169E30-8D8B-420E-B220-F5AA2E25F701.jpeg\" alt=\"SpaceX Falcon Heavy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4A169E30-8D8B-420E-B220-F5AA2E25F701.jpeg 2400w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4A169E30-8D8B-420E-B220-F5AA2E25F701.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4A169E30-8D8B-420E-B220-F5AA2E25F701.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4A169E30-8D8B-420E-B220-F5AA2E25F701.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4A169E30-8D8B-420E-B220-F5AA2E25F701.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4A169E30-8D8B-420E-B220-F5AA2E25F701.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4A169E30-8D8B-420E-B220-F5AA2E25F701.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4A169E30-8D8B-420E-B220-F5AA2E25F701.jpeg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/4A169E30-8D8B-420E-B220-F5AA2E25F701.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2432850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credits: SpaceX<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The central booster will be expended, while the two side boosters will land at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.<\/p>\n<p>Check back on this post tomorrow morning for a livestream of the launch, courtesy of SpaceX.<\/p>\n<p><em>Update: The story was updated to reflect that the launch is NET Nov 1.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thousands will be gathering on Florida\u2019s Space Coast tomorrow to watch SpaceX launch the massive Falcon Heavy rocket for the first time since 2019.
